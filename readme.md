## Project Description

My part of this project aimed to connect a lightbulb to the network using a Raspberry Pi. Docker was used to build the environment, containing Grafana, Prometheus, a simple administrative panel, Portainer for Docker management, a Zigbee bulb portal for controlling the lightbulb, and a livestream for observing the lightbulb's effects in real-time. Livestreaming allowed us to capture images of the lightbulb to see its effects live.

## Components Description

### Grafana

Grafana is used for visualizing data related to the connected lightbulb. You can customize the displayed graphs and panels according to your needs.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is used for collecting data from various sources. Here, we use it to monitor the operation of the lightbulb and other aspects of the project.

### Administrative Panel

The simple administrative panel provides an interface for managing the Raspberry Pi device and the connected lightbulb.

### Portainer

Portainer is used for managing Docker containers, making it easier to deploy and manage our application components.

### Zigbee Bulb Portal

The Zigbee bulb portal provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the connected lightbulb.

### Live stream

The livestream feature, using ESP-CAM, allows us to capture images of the lightbulb in action, providing real-time feedback on its effects.
