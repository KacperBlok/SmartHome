## Project Description

This project from my part aims to connect a lightbulb to the network using a Raspberry Pi. Docker was used to build the environment, containing Grafana, Prometheus, and a simple administrative panel. The whole setup was deployed on a WAN network.

## Components Description

### Grafana

Grafana is used for visualizing data related to the connected lightbulb. You can customize the displayed graphs and panels according to your needs.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is used for collecting data from various sources. Here, we use it to monitor the operation of the lightbulb and other aspects of the project.

### Administrative Panel

The simple administrative panel provides an interface for managing the Raspberry Pi device and the connected lightbulb.
